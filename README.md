# tac-master

**Autonomous Tactical Agentic Coding orchestrator.** Runs as a systemd
service on a Debian 13 LXC, watches GitHub issues across a configured
allowlist of repos, and executes full PITER pipelines
(**P**lan → **I**mplement → **T**est → **E**valuate → **R**elease)
without human intervention. Self-improves by running ADWs against its own
codebase.

---

## What it does, concretely

1. You open an issue on a repo that `krypto-agent` has access to.
2. Within 20 seconds, `tac-master` detects the issue, classifies it
   (`/chore`, `/bug`, `/feature`, or `/patch`), and spawns a **Lead**
   process in an isolated git worktree.
3. The Lead generates an implementation plan, commits it, opens a PR, and
   spawns **Workers** for the remaining PITER phases.
4. Workers build the change, run tests, perform a visual review (via
   Playwright MCP), generate documentation, and — if the repo is marked
   `auto_merge: true` — ship it straight to main.
5. Every run writes a reflection lesson into `state/knowledge/` that
   future Leads can draw on.
6. Issues filed on **this** repo trigger self-improvement runs with the
   same full-auto loop.

### PITER phases

| Phase | ADW script | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **P**lan | `adw_plan_iso.py` | Classify issue, generate implementation plan, commit, open PR |
| **I**mplement | `adw_build_iso.py` | Execute the plan, commit code changes |
| **T**est | `adw_test_iso.py` | Run unit + E2E tests, auto-fix failures |
| **E**valuate | `adw_review_iso.py` | Playwright-based visual review, spec compliance |
| **R**elease | `adw_document_iso.py` + `adw_ship_iso.py` | Docs, final merge |

Orchestrators that chain multiple phases live in the same directory:
`adw_plan_build_iso.py`, `adw_sdlc_iso.py` (full PITER), `adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py`
(full PITER + auto-merge, "Zero Touch Engineering").

### Leads and Workers

These aren't separate agent types — they're **roles** within the existing
tac-7 ADW hierarchy:

- The **Orchestrator daemon** is a persistent Python process polling
  GitHub. One per LXC.
- A **Lead** is an `adw_plan_iso.py` invocation. One per active issue.
  Lives as a detached OS process, owns a worktree, survives across polling
  cycles, tracked in `state/tac_master.sqlite`.
- **Workers** are the phase-specific ADW scripts (`adw_build_iso.py`,
  `adw_test_iso.py`, …). Each runs in the same worktree as its Lead, under
  the Lead's process tree.

Isolation level: **full subprocess isolation** — Leads and Workers run as
separate Python processes, each spawning its own `claude` CLI session. No
shared memory, no cross-contamination.

## The four pillars

tac-master is built on four independently verifiable subsystems:

### 1. Token accounting (closes the budget gap)

Every ADW phase writes its raw Claude Code output to
`agents/<adw_id>/<agent_name>/cc_raw_output.jsonl`. The token tracker
parses these files after each run completes, extracts `usage` and
`total_cost_usd` from assistant + result messages, prices unpriced tokens
via `config/model_prices.yaml`, and writes atomic rows into a new
`token_ledger` table plus the rolling `budget_usage` counters. **Idempotent
on (adw_id, phase_name, file_path)** — safe to re-scan after restart.

CLI:
```bash
uv run orchestrator/token_tracker.py --adw-id abc1d2e3   # one run
uv run orchestrator/token_tracker.py --scan-all          # backfill
```

### 2. Knowledge base (self-improvement retrieval)

After every completed run, `adw_reflect_iso.py` writes a lesson as BOTH
a markdown file (`state/knowledge/*.md`, human-readable) AND a row in
the SQLite `lessons` table with an FTS5 virtual table for relevance
search. At dispatch time, the Dispatcher calls
`KnowledgeBase.fetch_relevant(issue_title, repo_url, k=3)` and writes the
top-K lessons into the worktree as `agents/_knowledge/prompt_tail.md` for
the Lead's planner to consume.

CLI:
```bash
uv run orchestrator/knowledge.py search "sql injection" --limit 5
uv run orchestrator/knowledge.py recent
uv run orchestrator/knowledge.py count
```

### 3. Multi-repo webhook server (real-time ingestion)

Complements the 20s polling daemon with sub-second webhook ingestion.
FastAPI app on port 8088, HMAC-SHA256 signature verified against
`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Handles `issues.opened`, `issues.labeled`, and
`issue_comment.created`. Returns 202 immediately to beat GitHub's 10s
delivery timeout and dispatches in a background task. Runs as its own
systemd unit (`tac-master-webhook.service`) alongside the polling daemon.

Point each allowlisted repo's webhook at:
```
https://<your-host>/webhook/github
Content type: application/json
Secret:       <GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET>
Events:       Issues, Issue comments
```

### 4. Multi-repo dashboard (real-time observability)

Ported from tac-8/app3 with multi-repo extensions:

- **Bun + SQLite server** (`dashboard/server`): ingests hook events via
  `POST /events`, broadcasts over `ws://host:4000/stream`, and exposes
  read-only views over the orchestrator's state store at `/api/repos`,
  `/api/runs`, `/api/lessons`.
- **Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind client** (`dashboard/client`): three-panel
  layout — `RepoStatusBoard` (tile per allowlisted repo showing live/ok/fail
  counts, tokens, cost), `RunsPanel` (active and recent runs), `EventStream`
  (live hook feed with repo-scoped filtering, auto-scroll).
- **`.claude/hooks/send_event.py`**: POSTs every hook invocation to the
  dashboard with `repo_url`, `adw_id`, and `phase` auto-detected from the
  worktree context. Wired into all 7 hooks via `.claude/settings.json`.
  Never blocks Claude Code — always exits 0.

All four subsystems share the same `state/tac_master.sqlite` file (WAL
mode for multi-process safety). The dashboard opens tac_master.sqlite
read-only; writes go exclusively through the Python orchestrator.

## Install

### One-liner on a Proxmox VE host (recommended)

From your Proxmox VE host shell, as root:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryptobaseddev/tac-master/main/deploy/proxmox/create-tac-master-lxc.sh)"
```

This downloads the Debian 13 "Trixie" template, creates an unprivileged
LXC with `nesting=1,keyctl=1`, boots it, clones tac-master inside, runs
`deploy/install.sh`, and prints the dashboard URLs. Takes ~5 minutes.

Unattended mode for scripted deploys:

```bash
UNATTENDED=1 CT_ID=900 CT_MEMORY=8192 CT_DISK=64 TAC_WITH_CONTAINERS=1 \
    bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryptobaseddev/tac-master/main/deploy/proxmox/create-tac-master-lxc.sh)"
```

See [`deploy/proxmox/create-tac-master-lxc.sh`](deploy/proxmox/create-tac-master-lxc.sh)
for all env overrides.

### Manual install inside an existing Debian 13 host

If you already have a Debian 13 VM or LXC:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/install.sh
sudoedit /srv/tac-master/config/identity.env       # add PAT + API key
sudoedit /srv/tac-master/config/repos.yaml         # add allowlisted repos
sudo -u krypto bash -lc 'cd /srv/tac-master && uv run orchestrator/daemon.py --doctor'
sudo systemctl start tac-master tac-master-webhook tac-master-dashboard
journalctl -u tac-master -f
```

### Full walkthrough

See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for the detailed Proxmox
walkthrough, headless Claude Code notes, optional Podman runtime mode,
and ongoing maintenance with `scripts/tac-update.sh`.

---

## Configuration

### `config/repos.yaml` — allowlist

Every repo tac-master is allowed to act on. Non-listed repos are ignored
even if the `krypto-agent` account has access. See the sample for all
fields.

### `config/budgets.yaml` — cost controls

Daily token + run caps, concurrent run limits, circuit-breaker behavior
when exceeded. Defaults: 10M tokens/day globally, 2M per repo, 15 concurrent
runs max.

### `config/policies.yaml` — execution policies

Protected branches, forbidden paths (never touch `.env`, keys, secrets),
max files/lines per PR, per-workflow rate limits. The
`self_improvement:` section governs what tac-master may do to its own repo.

### `config/identity.env` — secrets

`GITHUB_PAT`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, bot user, webhook secret. `chmod 600`.
Never commit.

---

## Triggering work

Three ways to get tac-master to act on an issue:

1. **Open a new issue** on an allowlisted repo → picked up on the next poll
   (if `new_issue` is in `triggers:`).
2. **Comment `adw`** on an existing issue → picked up on the next poll
   (if `comment_adw` is in `triggers:`).
3. **Apply a trigger label** (e.g. `tac-master`, `krypto`) → picked up on
   the next poll (if `label` is in `triggers:`).

Each trigger fires exactly once per unique issue/comment combination —
tac-master tracks processed state in `state/tac_master.sqlite`.

---

## Self-improvement loop

tac-master's own repo is just another allowlisted repo in `repos.yaml`,
marked `self: true`. When you file an issue here:

1. The daemon sees it on the next poll and dispatches a Lead.
2. The Lead clones tac-master into `repos/OWNER_tac-master/`, creates a
   worktree, and runs the `sdlc_zte` workflow (Opus model set for
   higher-quality self-modifications).
3. On success, the PR is auto-merged per user policy.
4. `policies.yaml > self_improvement > post_merge_health_check` runs a
   `--doctor` check after merge; on failure, the merge is reverted.
5. `adws/adw_reflect_iso.py` writes a lesson to `state/knowledge/` for
   future Leads to draw on.

The safety net for full autonomy is:
- **Budget caps** in `budgets.yaml`
- **Forbidden paths** in `policies.yaml` (never touch secrets, keys)
- **Post-merge health check** with automatic rollback
- **Fine-grained PAT scope** limited to allowlisted repos

---

## PITER vs. tac-7's "SDLC" terminology

tac-7's code and docs use "SDLC" (Software Development Life Cycle). The
phases are identical to PITER; the naming is a translation:

| PITER letter | tac-7 term | Script |
|---|---|---|
| **P**lan | plan | `adw_plan_iso.py` |
| **I**mplement | build | `adw_build_iso.py` |
| **T**est | test | `adw_test_iso.py` |
| **E**valuate | review | `adw_review_iso.py` |
| **R**elease | document + ship | `adw_document_iso.py`, `adw_ship_iso.py` |

The SDLC script names are kept as-is inside `adws/` to avoid divergence
from tac-7. README and docs use PITER when speaking conceptually.

---

## Lineage

Built on the layered lessons from `tac-1` through `tac-8`:

- **tac-1**: programmable primitives (`programmable/{sh,ts,py}`)
- **tac-2→tac-4**: ADW bootstrap + plan/build pipeline + hooks
- **tac-5**: modular `adw_modules/`, test phase, state piping
- **tac-6**: review + document phases, R2 uploads, Playwright MCP
- **tac-7**: full isolation (worktrees, ports, model_set), ship phase, ZTE
- **tac-8**: worked examples — task.md coordination, observability
  dashboards, Notion-driven prototyping, multi-agent patterns

tac-master lifts the full tac-7 substrate unchanged and adds the missing
three layers: **a persistent daemon, project-agnostic dispatch, and a
self-improvement loop**.
